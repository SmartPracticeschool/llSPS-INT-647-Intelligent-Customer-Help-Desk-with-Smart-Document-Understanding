## Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding
### 1.1 Overview
We will be able to write an application that leverages multiple Watson AI services like
Discovery, Assistant, Cloud Function and Node Red. By the end of the project we will
learn best practices of combining Watson Services, and how they can build interactive
retrieval system with discovery + assistant.
1. Project Requirements: IBM Cloud, IBM Watson
2. Functional Requirements: IBM Cloud
3. Technical Requirements: Watson AI, ML
4. Software Requirements: Watson Assistant, Watson Discovery, Node Red
5. Project Deliverables: Report
6. Project Duration: 1 Month
### 1.2 Purpose
The chatbot usually can answer just simple questions, such as store locations and hours,
directions and maybe even making appointments. When any user input (question) falls
out of the scope of the predetermined question set of chatbot, it typically tells us to
rephrase our sentence or mention that this question is not valid.
In this project we will be emphasizing to reduce the workload from the representative
by supervising our chatbot in such a way that it is able to answer much of the questions
(in particular the product information). We can return the relevant sections from the
user guide which can help us to reduce the number of clients of every representative at
a call centre. We will be transferring the call to representatives in particular cases only.
To take this a step further, the project shall use the Smart Document Understanding
provided by the Watson Discovery to train on the text, which is a modified version of
Natural Language Processing.
### 1.3 Scope of Work:
1. Create a customer care dialog skill in Watson Assistant.
2. Use smart document understanding to build an enhanced Watson Discovery
   Collection.
3. Create an IBM Cloud Function web action that allows Watson Assistant to post
   queries to Watson Discovery.
4. Build a web application with integration of all the services and deploy the same on
   IBM Cloud Platform.
